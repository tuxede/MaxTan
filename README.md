# MaxTan
this is a simple game made by me, using c++ ang openGL (freeglut) library.
It imitates an adroid game called BBtan. You just shoot some rectangles with projectile, each collision between those takes away 1 point from a rectangle. Every level, objects on a screen slide down a bit. If you fail to destroy it before it touches the bottom, you loose. Then, next game starts automatically from level 1. It's quite playable, random objects generator is set in a way that it makes the game mediocrely hard.
